Scenario 2: Temperature Change Over a Week

Plot a line chart showing temperature variation over 7 days in a city.

Algorithm:

1. Define list of days (Mon to Sun).

2. Define corresponding temperature values.

3. Plot line chart with markers and dashed lines.

4. Label x-axis as days and y-axis as temperature.

5. Add a title and enable grid.

Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
temperature = [28, 30, 32, 31, 29, 27, 26]
plt.plot(days, temperature, marker='o', linestyle='--', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Days of the week')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.title('Temperature Variation Over a Week')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
